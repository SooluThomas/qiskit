"Instead of just *accessing* Qiskit Chemistry as a library of quantum "
"algorithms and tools to experiment with quantum computing for chemistry, "
"a user may decide to *contribute* to Qiskit Chemistry by providing new "
"components. These can be programmatically added to Qiskit Chemistry, "
"which was designed as an extensible, pluggable framework. Once added, new"
" components are automatically discovered."

"Researchers and developers can contribute to Qiskit Chemistry by "
"providing new components, which will be automatically discovered and "

"run time:"

"The class implementing the component should be placed in the appropriate "
"folder in the file system, as explained in `Section \"Extension Points\" "
"<#extension-points>`__ below for each different component type. This is "
"the easiest approach.  Researchers and developers extending Qiskit "
"Chemistry are more likely to have installed Qiskit Chemistry by cloning "
"the `Qiskit Chemistry GitHub repository <https://github.com/Qiskit"
"/qiskit-chemistry>`__ as opposed to using the pip package manager system."

"Alternatively, a developer extending Qiskit Chemistry with a new "

"fadding the entry points for ``qiskit.chemistry.drivers`` and or "
"``qiskit.chemistry.operators`` as shown below. The format is: ``anyname ="

"The driver support in Qiskit Chemistry was designed to make the "
":ref:`drivers` pluggable and discoverable. In order for Qiskit Chemistry "
"to be able to interface a driver library, the ``BaseDriver`` base class "
"must be implemented so to provide the interfacing code, or *wrapper*. As "
"part of this process, the required `JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) "
"<http://json.org>`__ schema for the driver interface must be supplied in "
"a CONFIGURATION static property in the class. The interfacing code in the"
" driver wrapper is responsible for constructing and populating a "
"``QMolecule`` instance with the electronic structure data listed above. "
"Driver wrappers implementing the ``BaseDriver`` class are organized in "
"subfolders of the ``drivers`` folder for automatic discovery and dynamic "
"lookup."
