"Ignis provides code for users to easily generate circuits for specific "
"experiments given a minimal set of user input parameters. Ignis code "
"contains three fundamental building blocks:"

"The circuits module provides the code to generate the list of circuits "
"for a particular Ignis experiment based on a minimal set of user "
"parameters. These are then run on Terra or Aer."

msgid ""
"The results of an Ignis experiment are passed to the Fitters module where"
" they are analyzed and fit according to the physics model describing the "
"experiment. Fitters can plot the data plus fit and output a list of "
"parameters."

"For certain Ignis experiments, the fitters can output a Filter object. "
"Filters can be used to mitigate errors in other experiments using the "
"calibration results of an Ignis experiment."

"Verification experiments are designed to verify gate and small circuit "
"performance. Verification includes state and process tomography, quantum "

msgid ""
"Mitigation experiments run calibration circuits that are analyzed to "
"generate mitigation routines that can be applied to arbitrary sets of "
"results run on the same backend. Ignis code will generate a list of "
"circuits that run calibration measurements. The results of these "
"measurements will be processed by a Fitter and will output a Filter than "
"can be used to apply mitigation to other results."
