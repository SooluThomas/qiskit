"Qiskit Aer provides a high performance simulator framework for quantum "
"circuits using the Qiskit software stack. It contains optimized C++ "
"simulator backends for executing circuits compiled in Qiskit Terra. Aer "
"also provides tools for constructing highly configurable noise models for"
" performing realistic noisy simulations of the errors that occur during "
"execution on real devices."
