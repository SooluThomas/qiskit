msgstr ""

#: of qiskit.transpiler.passes.mapping.lookahead_swap:4
msgid "The role of the mapper pass is to modify the starting circuit to be compatible with the target device's topology (the set of two-qubit gates available on the hardware.) To do this, the mapper will insert SWAP gates to relocate the virtual qubits for each upcoming gate onto a set of coupled physical qubits. However, as SWAP gates are particularly lossy, the goal is to accomplish this remapping while introducing the fewest possible additional SWAPs."
