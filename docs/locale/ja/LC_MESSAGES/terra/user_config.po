msgid "When using Qiskit Terra there are several aspects of the library where Terra has opinionated defaults. These defaults are normally in the interest of supporting the least common demonitator between users. For example, the default backend for ``qiskit.visualization.circuit_drawer()``/``QuantumCircuit.draw()`` is the text backend. However, depending on your local environment you may want to change these defaults to something better suited for your use case. This is what the user config file can be used for. It lets you optionally specify local defaults for these things"

msgid "By default the user config file should be located in ``~/.qiskit/settings.conf``. It is a ``.ini`` file that lists any options you'd like to change the defaults on. Right now there is only one supported option, ``circuit_drawer`` which is used to set the default backend used when running the circuit drawer."

msgid "In this file when you call the circuit drawer the default output will be ``'mpl'`` instead of ``'text'``. You can use any of the valid circuit drawer backends as the value for this config, this includes ``text``, ``mpl``, ``latex``, and ``latex_source``. These are the only valid values for the ``circuit_drawer`` field."

When ``QISKIT_SETTINGS`` is set Qiskit Terra will try to use the value as the path to the user config file."
