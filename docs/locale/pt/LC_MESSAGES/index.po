msgid "Qiskit is an open-source framework for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:8
msgid "A central goal of Qiskit is to build a software stack that makes it easy for anyone to use quantum computers. However, Qiskit also aims to facilitate research on the most important open issues facing quantum computation today."
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:12
msgid "You can use Qiskit to easily design experiments and run them on simulators and real quantum computers."

msgid ":ref:`Qiskit Terra <Terra>`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:29
msgid "Terra, the ‘earth’ element, is the foundation on which the rest of Qiskit lies. Terra provides a bedrock for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, to optimize them for the constraints of a particular device, and to manage the execution of batches of experiments on remote-access devices. Terra defines the interfaces for a desirable end-user experience, as well as the efficient handling of layers of optimization, pulse scheduling and backend communication."

msgid ":ref:`Qiskit Aer <Aer>`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:38
msgid "Aer, the ‘air’ element, permeates all Qiskit elements. To really speed up development of quantum computers we need better simulators, emulators and debuggers.  Aer helps us understand the limits of classical processors by demonstrating to what extent they can mimic quantum computation. Furthermore, we can use Aer to verify that current and near-future quantum computers function correctly. This can be done by stretching the limits of simulation, and by simulating the effects of realistic noise on the computation."

msgid ":ref:`Qiskit Ignis <Ignis>`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:48
msgid "Ignis, the ‘fire’ element, is dedicated to fighting noise and errors and to forging a new path. This includes better characterization of errors, improving gates, and computing in the presence of noise. Ignis is meant for those who want to design quantum error correction codes, or who wish to study ways to characterize errors through methods such as tomography, or even to find a better way for using gates by exploring dynamical decoupling and optimal control."

msgid ":ref:`Qiskit Aqua <Aqua>`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:57
msgid "Aqua, the ‘water’ element, is the element of life. To make quantum computing live up to its expectations, we need to find real-world applications. Aqua is where algorithms for quantum computers are built. These algorithms can be used to build applications for quantum computing. Aqua is accessible to domain experts in chemistry, optimization, finance and AI, who want to explore the benefits of using quantum computers as accelerators for specific computational tasks."
