msgid "Qiskit Finance is a set of tools and algorithms that enable experimenting with financial analysis and optimization problems via quantum computing. Aqua Finance is the only end-to-end software stack that translates finance-specific problems into inputs for one of the :ref:`quantum-algorithms` in :ref:`aqua-library`, which in turn uses Qiskit Terra for the actual quantum computation on top a quantum simulator or a real quantum hardware device."

msgid "Qiskit Finance allows users with different levels of experience to execute financial analysis and optimization experiments and contribute to the quantum computing finance software stack. Users with a pure finance background or interests can continue to configure financial analysis and optimization problems without having to learn the details of the underlying quantum computing system."
